# Simple XOR Encryptor
A simple Python CLI tool for encrypting and decrypting files using XOR encryption
This project is for learning purposes only
XOR encryption is not secure for real world usage

## Features XOR file encryption
- XOR file decryption
- Binary file support
- Simple CLI interface

## Included Example File
The repository contains example.txt 
You can use this file to test the encryption and decryption process

## How to use
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/mmarg0o/simple-xor-encryptor.git
cd simple-xor-encryptor
2. Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script:
python xorpr.py
The encrypted file will be saved as:
encrypted.bin
Run the tool again with the same key to decrypt it back
